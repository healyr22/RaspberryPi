The lambda was cool. For NodeJs, used a handler in index.js. for Java, just pointed to the main class

For the google action, currently using HellowWorld and it calls the web hook

Nodejs won't work because puppeteer dependency is too large for lambda apparently. Tried using lambda layers but couldn't get it to work

Java won't work because you need to install a driver (would need a Vm like docker or something)

Perhaps next steps is to setup my own server here


... ended up using the lambda as a gateway (because the google action needs a https endpoint). Then the lambda just calls the ec2 instance which is the custom API I made.
Can't get the ec2 instance to be https because have to create a certificate and get registered and stuff, this was easier
